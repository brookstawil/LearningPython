# Brooks Tawil Assignment 1

#Part 1

#Run time error
#var1 + 5 (var1 has not yet been defined and thus will result in a run time error)

#Set up variables
var1 = 3
var2 = 6
var3 = var1 * var2

#Logic error
#var3 = var2 (No matter what var1 is the program will only print out var3 as 6)

#Print variables
print(var1)
print(var2)
print(var3)

#Syntax error
#print{var 3} (Curly brackets do not act as parenthesis and will result in a syntax error)

#Runtime error
#priz(var3) (The command "priz" is not valid and will cause a runtime error)

#Syntax error
#print(var1 (The missing parenthesis will show up as a syntax error)

#Division
var4 = var1 / var2
print (var4)


#Part 2


print ("Now that that's done lets play some Mad Libs!")
